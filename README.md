# Writing Code Without Writing Code

Talk for a [UQ Computing Society](https://uqcs.org) and [MSS](https://uqmss.org/) collaboration event, delivered on 21/05/2022.

## What?

[Formal methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods) is a long studied (though only recently appreciated) field marrying mathematics and computer science, that concerns itself with reasoning about programs. It sees applications on topics ranging from verification of software to binary analysis and code generation.

This talk serves as an introduction to the field, with a worked example of writing an algorithm from specification alone!
